A proof-of-concept implementation for a really, really big HTML table.

More details can be found at http://blog.jbrantly.com/2010/03/really-really-big-html-table.html

The Prototype JS library is required and included. However, it is only used for attaching events, and can easily be replaced.

Note that this implementation is not production ready and is intended as a proof-of-concept for a technique. The source code may be useful, however, in creating a production-ready component.
